# InputAT allows you to receive user input from anywhere on the screen, contrary to the default INPUT instruction. InputAT should be a function within your program specifying the x,y cursur screen starting postion, whereas INPUT forces lower left of screen only.

Future Plans: To allow the cursur line by line. At present <return> clears a$ when starting a new line, however, this command is usually intended to collect, only 1 integer or 1 word.
